Release Notes
==================

v1.0.0 (2017-10-13)
-------------------

- Update Travis and Tox configurations
- Drop support for Python < 2.7
- Add support for Python 3.5 and 3.6
- Drop support for Django < 1.8
- Add support for Django 1.9, 1.10, and 1.11
- Removed all custom cache backends.
- Flake8 fixes

Backwards Incompatible Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Cache Machine previously included custom backends for LocMem, Memcached and PyLibMemcached. These
  were necessary because the core backends in old versions of Django did not support infinte
  timeouts. They now do, so Cache Machine's custom backends are no longer necessary. They have been
  removed, so you should revert to using the core Django backends.

v0.9.1 (2015-10-22)
-------------------

- Fix bug that prevented objects retrieved via cache machine from being
  re-cached by application code (see PR #103)
- Fix bug that prevented caching objects forever when using Django <= 1.5
  (see PR #104)
- Fix regression (introduced in 0.8) that broke invalidation when an object
  was cached via a slave database and later modified or deleted via the
  master database, when using master/slave replication (see PR #105). Note
  this change may cause unexpected invalidation when sharding across DBs
  that share both a schema and primary key values or other attributes.

v0.9 (2015-07-29)
-----------------

- Support for Python 3
- A new setting, ``CACHE_INVALIDATE_ON_CREATE``, which facilitates invalidation
  when a new model object is created. For more information, see
  :ref:`object-creation`.

v0.8.1 (2015-07-03)
-----------------------

This release is primarily aimed at adding support for more recent versions of
Django and catching up on recent contributions.

- Support for Django 1.7 and Django 1.8
- Fix bug in parsing of ``REDIS_BACKEND`` URI
- Miscellaneous bug fixes and documentation corrections

Backwards Incompatible Changes
________________________________

- Dropped support for the old style ``caching.backends.memcached.CacheClass`` and
  ``caching.backends.locmem.CacheClass`` classes. Support for this naming
  has been deprecated since Django 1.3. You will need to switch your project
  to use ``MemcachedCache``, ``PyLibMCCache``, or ``LocMemCache`` in place of
  ``CacheClass``.
